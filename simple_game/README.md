All the projects in this folder are games in form of bash scripts.
I am kind of using this to solidify my knowledge in bash scripts as i am still learning.
If you test this scripts, make sure to drop feedback on how i can improve and optimize my scripting skills.
simple1.sh is a more optimized simple.sh in that if you lose it will not exit the script like simple.sh but it will promt you to retry.
NOTE: To use the weather-forecast.sh script, you should know that part of the script depends on the states.txt file.
THANK YOU ALL :)
